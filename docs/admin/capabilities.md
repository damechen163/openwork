# M1 managed-action policy

OpenWork evaluates only actions executed by an OpenWork-managed adapter. The
M1 gateway does not claim to intercept arbitrary provider-native tools, model
syscalls, or activity outside the sandbox boundary, and it never executes an
action itself.

## Configuration

Policy is a versioned YAML document. Unknown fields, duplicate mappings,
unsupported versions, malformed rules, and unknown actions fail closed.

```yaml
version: 1
defaults:
  unknown: deny
actions:
  filesystem.read:
    risk: L0
    decision: allow
  filesystem.write:
    risk: L1
    decision: allow
    resources:
      exact:
        /workspace/protected.txt: deny
      default: allow
  email.send:
    risk: L3
    decision: approval
  database.delete:
    risk: L4
    decision: deny
```

An action rule derives both risk and decision. Request parameters cannot lower
risk. M1 permits `allow` for L0/L1 only, requires approval or denial for L2/L3,
and requires denial for L4. Unknown actions are treated as L4 and denied.

Resource matching is case-sensitive and exact. When an `exact` key does not
match, the resource rule's explicit `default` applies. Rules without a resource
section use the action-level decision.

`REQUIRE_APPROVAL` evaluations carry the exact canonical parameter hash from
the frozen action contract. Any action, resource, or integer-only parameter
change produces a different binding and requires reevaluation.
